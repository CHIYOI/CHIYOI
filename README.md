## Go
Go is our favourite language. It is very simple, but very powerful.

For building web services, the standard library `net/http` provides a `Server`-`Handler` architecture as a basic framework.
By defining our `Handler`s, we can easily build a wide range of web services.
By configuring the `Server`, we can control the behavior of the underlying network, like the listening address and the TLS configuration.

There are some features make this work even easier.
Using `context`, we can pass data synchronously during a HTTP request, and control the lifecycle of our service.
Using `chan`, we can pass data asynchronously among handlers or other parts of our program.

Go lifted some commonly used utilities onto the language level, like containers `map` and `slice`.
The syntax for common operations, like get, set, iterate, and pre-allocate memory, are almost the same.
Some other common data structures, like hash set and queue, can also be emulated by these basic containers, which leads to a minimal language API.

## C
C is a very first and very last programming language.

We control the data on our own, and think like a computer.
When designing algorithms in C, we are clear with the detailed work the computer will do for each step.

C is one of the very first programming languages, but is good until now.

## TypeScript with React
TypeScript with React is especially suitable for building graphical application.

TypeScript is a very flexible language.
It has good support for functional-style programming.
The typing system is flexible and smart, so that we can easily write code, and guarantee type safety at the same time.

React allows us to design graphical applications declaratively, with `state` and `render`.
We define our application as multiple `state`s, each has a pure `render` process.
After getting user interactions or other events, the application moves among `state`s and the graphical interface automatically re-`render`s.

## Rust
Rust is a beautiful language.

Elegent language features allow us to write very beautiful code.
Last-line return and value of control flow let us design functions without any explicite return.

Functional iterators pack the data and operations into monad.
We can forget how to let computer work, and only think about what we want.

Rust is designed for memory security and high performance.
It has no internal memory manager, but unlike C, the compiler manages everything well.
