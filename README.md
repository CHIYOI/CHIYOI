Rust is also a good language.

In Rust, there are a large amount of elegent strategies,
for example last-line-return and functional iterators.
With them we can write very beautiful code.

At the same time, Rust is designed for memory security and high performance.
Unlike C, the Rust compiler did most things for us.

*A programs is an art, coding is designing.*
