I've studied algorithm for some days, got some badges and wrote some solutions on leetcode. Mainly I use golang for algorithm learning because it's close to machine but very easy to code at the same time.

I've learned a little bit of web develop and made a simple one with *go* and *typescript*. I didn't use any framework for both front and back end, even didn't used http/css, but maybe some day it's impossible to avoid if my project is more complex.

There's a lot of things I havn't learned but I have confidence to master them if needed in the future.
