## Go
Go is my favorite language. It is very simple, but very powerful.
- Web Services

  - Trinity: Message service.
  - Atri: Message automata.
  - Dis: Discord Application interaction endpoint.
- Terminal Applications
  - Oncorhynchus/trinity: The command-line interface for *Trinity* service.

## C
I like C. It has a flavor of inferior beauty.
- slice: A very simple slice library.

## TypeScript
I like TypeScript/JavaScript as well. It is a very flexible language.
- Neko03 Page: Web/Native application.

## And More...
Rust is also a good language.

In Rust, there are a large amount of elegent strategies,
for example last-line-return and functional iterators.
With them we can write very beautiful code.

At the same time, Rust is designed for memory security and high performance.
Unlike C, the Rust compiler did most things for us.

I have also tried Python, Java, C-Sharp and Swift.
Maybe in the future I will use them to create something cool.

*A programs is an art, coding is designing.*
